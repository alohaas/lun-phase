# lun-phase

**still in the works**

One day you may receive:
1. A numerical value representing the moon's age in the current lunation
2. An emoji representing the moon's phase
3. The name of the current phase as a string
4. A unicode character representing the moon's phase


preview to the remix: `node test.js`

Thank you Ben Daglish for providing moon phase calculation methods.
