## Calculate the current phase of the moon...eventually.
**still in the works**


You may receive:
1. A numerical value representing the moon's age in the current lunation
2. An emoji representing the moon's phase
3. The name of the current phase as a string
4. A unicode character representing the moon's phase

Thank you Ben Daglish for providing moon phase calculation methods.
